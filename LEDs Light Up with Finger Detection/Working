 Hand Detection (Python): The webcam captures your hand, and the Python code processes the image to count the number of fingers shown.

Finger Count: Based on the hand's contours and convexity defects, Python counts how many fingers are being shown and sends a corresponding number (0-3) via serial communication to the Arduino.

Arduino Response: The Arduino receives the serial data (number of fingers) and lights up a specific number of LEDs:

1 finger: Turns on LED 1.
2 fingers: Turns on LED 1 & LED 2.
3 or more fingers: Turns on all 3 LEDs.
No fingers: Turns off all LEDs.
