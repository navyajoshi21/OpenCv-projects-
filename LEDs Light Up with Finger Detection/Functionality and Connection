Objective:
To learn how to integrate computer vision with hardware control, 
introducing basics of OpenCV, Python, and Arduino programming 
while making an interactive hardware-based project.

Functionality:
If 1 finger is detected, LED 1 (connected to pin 13) lights up.
If 2 fingers are detected, LEDs 1 and 2 (pins 13 and 12) light up.
If 3 fingers are detected, all three LEDs (pins 13, 12, and 11) light up.
No fingers detected will turn off all LEDs.

Hardware Connections:
Ensure the LED is connected correctly:
The longer leg (anode) should be connected to the Arduino pin (e.g., pin 13).
The shorter leg (cathode) with the resistor and then should be connected to GND.
