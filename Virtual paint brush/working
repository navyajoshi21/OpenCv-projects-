1. Start Camera: Your webcam is activated, and the code starts capturing video frames using OpenCV.

2. Flip Frame: The video feed is flipped to behave like a mirror for intuitive interaction.

3 .Convert to RGB: The frame is changed to RGB color format because Mediapipe needs it for hand detection.

4. Detect Your Hand:Mediapipe finds the shape of your hand and creates a "map" of important points (like fingertips).

5 .Mark Fingers:It identifies the tip of your index finger and thumb from the map.

6. Measure Finger Distance:It calculates how far apart your index finger and thumb are. This tells whether you’re drawing or not:
Close = Pen Up (no drawing)
Far = Pen Down (draw!)

7. Pick Colors:If your finger hovers over a color button, it changes the "paint" color to match the button.

8. Draw on Canvas:When your fingers are apart, a circle of the selected color is drawn on an invisible canvas at your finger's position.

9. Blend Layers:OpenCV combines the invisible canvas with the live video so it looks like you’re drawing directly on the screen.

10. Show the Result:The final output is displayed in a window, updating in real-time.

11. Exit:Pressing 'q' stops everything and closes the application.
