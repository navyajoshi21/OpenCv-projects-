Start Camera:

Your webcam is activated, and the code starts capturing video frames using OpenCV.
Flip Frame:

The video feed is flipped to behave like a mirror for intuitive interaction.
Convert to RGB:

The frame is changed to RGB color format because Mediapipe needs it for hand detection.
Detect Your Hand:

Mediapipe finds the shape of your hand and creates a "map" of important points (like fingertips).
Mark Fingers:

It identifies the tip of your index finger and thumb from the map.
Measure Finger Distance:

It calculates how far apart your index finger and thumb are. This tells whether you’re drawing or not:
Close = Pen Up (no drawing)
Far = Pen Down (draw!)
Pick Colors:

If your finger hovers over a color button, it changes the "paint" color to match the button.
Draw on Canvas:

When your fingers are apart, a circle of the selected color is drawn on an invisible canvas at your finger's position.
Blend Layers:

OpenCV combines the invisible canvas with the live video so it looks like you’re drawing directly on the screen.
Show the Result:

The final output is displayed in a window, updating in real-time.
Exit:

Pressing 'q' stops everything and closes the application.
