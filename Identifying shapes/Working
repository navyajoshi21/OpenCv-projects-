1. Shape Detection (Python):
The webcam captures frames, and the Python code processes these frames to detect shapes.
The image is converted to grayscale, blurred, and edge detection (Canny) is applied to find contours.

2. Contour Analysis:
For each detected contour, the code approximates the shape and checks how many vertices (corners) it has.
The shape is identified based on the number of vertices:
3 vertices: Triangle
4 vertices: Square or Rectangle (checked using aspect ratio)
5 vertices: Pentagon
More than 5 vertices: Circle
Unknown shape: If none of the above conditions are met.

3.Shape Labeling:
The code calculates the centroid of each contour and displays the name of the shape (Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Pentagon, or Circle) near the shape in the webcam feed.
